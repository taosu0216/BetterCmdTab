/// Reads raw trackpad contacts via Apple's private `MultitouchSupport`
/// framework — the same mechanism BetterTouchTool / Swish use. Unlike the public
/// `NSEvent` `.swipe` monitor (which only fires when the user has set Trackpad →
/// "Swipe between pages" to three fingers, and isn't reliably delivered to a
/// background app), this works out of the box and regardless of which app is
/// frontmost.
///
/// The gesture is continuous: while three fingers stay down, horizontal travel
/// is accumulated and emits one step per `MTGesture.stepDistance` moved, so a
/// single slide can advance several apps. Direction is configurable.
///
/// Because it's a private framework the symbols and the contact-frame struct
/// layout are undocumented and could change between macOS releases — that's why
/// the feature is off by default and labeled experimental. Everything is loaded
/// with `dlopen`/`dlsym` so a missing or renamed symbol degrades to "feature
/// unavailable" instead of crashing at launch.
