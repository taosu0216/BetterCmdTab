/// switcher is open:
///
/// - **Switcher closed:** these `onKeyDown` handlers fire directly.
/// - **Switcher open:** the CGEvent tap in `HotkeyTap` matches the same chord
///   first (it intercepts keys while switching) and arranges the frontmost
///   focused window via `SwitcherController`, consuming the event so these
///   global handlers don't also fire. The switcher panel is a non-activating
///   `NSPanel`, so the frontmost app stays the user's real window — the chord
///   acts on it, not on the highlighted switcher row. The tap's chord map is
///   derived from the same BetterShortcuts bindings (see
///   `SwitcherController.pushWindowMgmtBindings`), so there's a single source
///   of truth.
///
/// Handlers are installed once at launch; they read the live binding through
/// BetterShortcuts, so changing a shortcut takes effect without re-registering.
