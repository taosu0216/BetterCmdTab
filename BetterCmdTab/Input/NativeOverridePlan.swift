/// Pure, side-effect-free description of how the app should override the native
/// macOS keyboard state right now. Everything in this file is plain value logic
/// (no AppKit, no WindowServer calls) so it can be unit-tested exhaustively.
///
/// **Always-armed.** The native ⌘Tab switcher is kept suppressed — the symbolic
/// hotkey disabled and our `RegisterEventHotKey` trigger registered — the *whole*
/// time the app runs, not just while another app holds Secure Event Input. The
/// reason is timing: when a password field grabs Secure Event Input the CGEvent
/// tap goes deaf *instantly*, but there is no notification for that transition
/// (only a poll), so a "disable on demand" scheme leaves a gap in which neither
/// the (now deaf) tap nor a (not-yet-registered) Carbon hot key handles ⌘Tab and
/// the **native** switcher fires. Arming both up front closes that gap: under
/// normal input the head-insert tap consumes ⌘Tab and opens our switcher (the
/// Carbon hot key never fires — the tap wins); the instant the tap goes deaf the
/// already-registered Carbon hot key takes over with no gap. The accepted cost:
/// the symbolic-hotkey disable outlives the process, so a crash / force-quit
/// leaves the system ⌘Tab disabled until the next launch (auto-healed via
/// `healStaleSymbolicHotkeyDisable`), the Privacy-pane Restore button, or
/// re-login.
///
/// Under Secure Event Input the tap is fully deaf, so the *only* keys that reach
/// the app are ⌘-qualified Carbon hot keys (plus the mouse). To make every
/// in-panel action work there, this plan *additionally* registers the whole
/// in-panel key set as modifier-qualified Carbon chords while the panel is open
/// and the hold modifier is physically down — letter-jump, fuzzy search, the
/// panel actions and tab drill included. Those are gated on secure input (when
/// the tap is alive it handles them directly and wins, so registering them then
/// is needless churn). Releasing the modifier is detected separately (no event is
/// delivered for it under secure input — see `HoldModifierMonitor`) and commits.

/// The configured trigger, in the Carbon terms the override decision needs.
///
/// `appEnabled` / `windowEnabled` are `false` when the user has *cleared* that
/// shortcut (BetterShortcuts' explicit "disabled" marker). A disabled trigger
/// reserves no native chord: its symbolic-hotkey disable and Carbon chords are
/// both dropped, so the native macOS ⌘Tab (or ⌘`) keeps working. They default
/// to `true` so existing call sites and tests describe an enabled trigger.
