## Why

macOS's built-in ⌘+Tab switches apps, not windows. Third-party alternatives either cost money (Witch, Contexts) or feel heavy and have not adopted Liquid Glass. BetterCmdTab is a single menu-bar agent that boots in milliseconds, draws with the system Liquid Glass material on macOS 26, and ships with no subscription, no license key, and no analytics.

## Features

- **Three layouts** — classic list, grid of icons, or live window previews.
- **Letter-prefix jump** — type a name to jump to it.
- **Search & launch** — press `/` to fuzzy-find, or launch any installed app.
- **Window switching** — `` ⌘+ ` `` cycles windows of the front app.
- **Tap or hold** — tap to switch instantly, hold to open the switcher.
- **Scroll to switch** — spin the mouse wheel to move through apps.
- **Recently closed** — reopen an app you just quit.
- **Minimized & hidden** — include minimized windows, hidden and windowless apps.
- **Pin & filter** — keep favorites up top, hide the rest.
- **Quick actions** — quit, close, minimize, hide inline.
- **Unread badges** — Dock badge counts, in the switcher.
- **Audio indicator** — flags apps playing sound.
- **Instant Spaces** — switch Spaces with no animation.
- **Liquid Glass** — system material on macOS 26.
- **Accent color** — tint the selection to match your system.
- **Multi-monitor** — opens on the screen under the cursor.
- **Trackpad & haptics** — three-finger swipe, optional feedback.
- **Configurable** — custom hotkey, size, scale, layout.

## Install

### Download

Grab the latest signed `.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/rokartur/BetterCmdTab/releases), open it, drag `BetterCmdTab.app` to `/Applications`, and launch.

On first launch macOS will ask for **Accessibility** permission — this is required for the global ⌘+Tab event tap and for reading window lists via the Accessibility API. Grant it under `System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility`.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rokartur/BetterCmdTab.git
cd BetterCmdTab
xcodebuild -scheme "BetterCmdTab Release" -configuration Release build
```

Requires Xcode 16+ and the macOS 26 SDK to build the Liquid Glass code paths. The deployment target is macOS 13.0 — older SDKs fall back to NSVisualEffectView automatically.

## Shortcuts

While Cmd is held:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd + Tab` | Next app |
| `Cmd + Tab, Shift ` | Previous app |
| `` Cmd + ` `` | Next window of current app |
| `` Cmd + Shift + ` `` | Previous window of current app |
| `Cmd + ←` / `Cmd + →` | Spatial navigation (Grid layout) |
| `Cmd + ↑` / `Cmd + ↓` | Vertical navigation |
| `Cmd + <letter(s)>` | Jump to app starting with that letter |
| `Cmd + /` | Toggle the fuzzy search bar (filter running + launch installed apps) |
| `Cmd + Q` | Quit the highlighted app |
| `Cmd + W` | Close the highlighted window |
| `Cmd + M` | Minimize the highlighted window |
| `Cmd + H` | Hide / unhide the highlighted app |
| `Cmd + Esc` | Cancel switcher without activating anything |
| `Release Cmd` | Activate the highlighted row |

The `Cmd + Tab` activation hotkey is configurable in Settings; you can also trigger the switcher with a three-finger trackpad swipe.

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or newer
- Accessibility permission

Liquid Glass rendering requires macOS 26. On 13–15 you get NSVisualEffectView with `.hudWindow` material, which looks similar enough.

## Privacy

BetterCmdTab does not collect, transmit, or store any data. There is no telemetry, no crash reporting service, no analytics SDK, and no account. The only network requests it makes are to `api.github.com` and `github.com` when checking for updates, and only when you ask it to.
