## Why

macOS's built-in ⌘+Tab switches apps, not windows. Third-party alternatives either cost money (Witch, Contexts) or feel heavy and have not adopted Liquid Glass. BetterCmdTab is a single menu-bar agent that boots in milliseconds, draws with the system Liquid Glass material on macOS 26, and ships with no subscription, no license key, and no analytics.

## Features

- **Two layouts** — classic vertical list, or a grid of app icons with spatial arrow-key navigation.
- **Letter-prefix jump** — type the first letters of an app's name to jump straight to it.
- **Fuzzy search & app launch** — press `/` to open the search bar: fuzzy-filter running apps, launch any *installed* app via an indexed catalog, or reopen one you recently closed.
- **Reopen recently closed apps** — apps you recently quit stay in the switcher so you can relaunch them.
- **Window-level switching** — `` ⌘+ ` `` cycles the windows of the frontmost app. Works on every app, including fullscreen.
- **Pin & filter** — pin the apps you reach for most and filter the rest out of the list.
- **Quick actions on the highlighted row** — quit, close window, minimize, hide, all without leaving the switcher.
- **Unread Dock badges** — surfaces the badge counts macOS shows on the Dock, in the switcher (on by default).
- **Audio indicator** — flags apps that are currently playing sound.
- **Instant Space switching** — committing a selection on another Space switches with no animation.
- **Liquid Glass backdrop on macOS 26**, NSVisualEffectView fallback below.
- **Multi-monitor aware** — opens on the screen with the cursor; repositions when displays connect, disconnect, or change resolution.
- **Trackpad & feedback** — a three-finger swipe can trigger the switcher, with optional haptic and sound feedback on commit.
- **Configurable & tunable** — set your own switcher hotkey, and adjust its size, scale, and layout in Settings.
- **Shift+tap** to step backwards without holding Tab.
- **Menu bar agent** — no dock icon, no main window, no Electron. The menu bar icon itself can be hidden.

## Install

### Download

Grab the latest signed `.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/rokartur/BetterCmdTab/releases), open it, drag `BetterCmdTab.app` to `/Applications`, and launch.

On first launch macOS will ask for **Accessibility** permission — this is required for the global ⌘+Tab event tap and for reading window lists via the Accessibility API. Grant it under `System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility`.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rokartur/BetterCmdTab.git
cd BetterCmdTab
xcodebuild -scheme "BetterCmdTab Release" -configuration Release build
```

Requires Xcode 16+ and the macOS 26 SDK to build the Liquid Glass code paths. The deployment target is macOS 13.0 — older SDKs fall back to NSVisualEffectView automatically.

## Shortcuts

While Cmd is held:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd + Tab` | Next app |
| `Cmd + Tab, Shift ` | Previous app |
| `` Cmd + ` `` | Next window of current app |
| `` Cmd + Shift + ` `` | Previous window of current app |
| `Cmd + ←` / `Cmd + →` | Spatial navigation (Grid layout) |
| `Cmd + ↑` / `Cmd + ↓` | Vertical navigation |
| `Cmd + <letter(s)>` | Jump to app starting with that letter |
| `Cmd + /` | Toggle the fuzzy search bar (filter running + launch installed apps) |
| `Cmd + Q` | Quit the highlighted app |
| `Cmd + W` | Close the highlighted window |
| `Cmd + M` | Minimize the highlighted window |
| `Cmd + H` | Hide / unhide the highlighted app |
| `Cmd + Esc` | Cancel switcher without activating anything |
| `Release Cmd` | Activate the highlighted row |

The `Cmd + Tab` activation hotkey is configurable in Settings; you can also trigger the switcher with a three-finger trackpad swipe.

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or newer
- Accessibility permission

Liquid Glass rendering requires macOS 26. On 13–15 you get NSVisualEffectView with `.hudWindow` material, which looks similar enough.

## Privacy

BetterCmdTab does not collect, transmit, or store any data. There is no telemetry, no crash reporting service, no analytics SDK, and no account. The only network requests it makes are to `api.github.com` and `github.com` when checking for updates, and only when you ask it to.
